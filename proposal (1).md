# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Poker Night with a Deadly Twist

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A thrilling poker game where players face high stakes: losers of each poker hand play a round of Russian roulette. Players can compete locally against bots or online with other players.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This project will combine the classic card game of poker with an intense twist inspired by Russian roulette, aiming to create a unique and suspenseful game experience. The game will function as a turn-based poker game in which multiple players (including bots or potentially online players) bet, check, fold, and call each hand to try and win. After each poker hand, the players with the lowest hands will have to face a "Russian roulette" challenge, where they have a random chance of elimination. This feature will be simulated with a revolver mechanic, where one chamber is loaded and randomly chosen losers take turns “firing.”
The game will be built using Unity, which allows for a visually engaging interface and potential online play. Basic bot logic will enable local play, while online capabilities may allow real players to connect in multiplayer mode. Players will have access to interactive menus, gameplay instructions, and graphical representations of cards and the Russian roulette sequence.



## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Basic poker game mechanics (deal cards, check hands, evaluate winner).
Russian roulette mechanic triggered for losing players after each round.
Local play against bots.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Fully functional local play with bots, complete with visual card representations.
A working Russian roulette sequence with basic animations.
Graphical interface with buttons for player actions (check, bet, fold).

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Complete game with both local bot and online multiplayer modes.
Advanced bot behavior with varied strategies.
Detailed animations and effects for both poker and Russian roulette phases, including sound effects for enhanced immersion.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The next steps involve learning the basics of Unity’s interface and its C# scripting environment, focusing first on card and deck management for the poker game. I’ll need to become proficient in C# syntax and Unity’s GameObjects and Components to create interactive game elements. After establishing the poker logic, I’ll research Unity’s animation features to bring the Russian roulette sequence to life, starting with particle effects or simple animations to add tension.

Additionally, I’ll look into networking for Unity if I have time for the online component, focusing on Unity’s Netcode for GameObjects or Photon. I’ll work independently to balance these tasks, with a primary focus on getting local play fully functional and a stretch goal of online play if time permits.
