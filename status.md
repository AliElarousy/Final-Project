#### Project title

Poker Night

***

Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I've created the game and added most features that I intend to have but with a few adjustments to my original idea as I realized the difficulty and unrealistic scale of my initial plan.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I haven't added the Russian roulette aspect of the game yet.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

a lot, but the most annoying problem I've had was getting errors or having things go wrong because I forgot to save at some point during my work.
